News Analyzer

Project - To create a website that will take in an RSS feed from two news providers and run a text analyzer against the articles.  It will provide a summary of the word and letter frequencies, as well as a positivity index for each article and overall.

Use – The site is intended to be used by general population to pre-screen news sources and use the positivity index to note the tone of the articles.  This will help users select their preferred news sources.

Personas - Two personas will be considered, a technology savvy person and one that is a neophyte and requires help.

Architecture – The application will be a full stack application using a Python back-end and authentication, with a database to store the articles that have been analyzed and the results of the analysis.
